            <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
            The rules are as old as time, but unless you've been living under, well, paper:
            Rock breaks scissors, scissors cut paper, paper covers rock. It's a vicious circle.
            No one knows why a rock gives up when it's covered by a piece of paper, but that's neither here nor there.
